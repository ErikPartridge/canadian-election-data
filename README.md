# Canadian Election Data Starter Kit 

If you're looking to analyze Canadian elections, the data is pretty sparse. This repository aims to combine data from a wide variety of sources, and make it available to the general public.

Riding data for 2003 and 2013 is from Statistics Canada, polling data from Wikipedia.
